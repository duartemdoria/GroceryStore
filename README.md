## üöÄ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up the local development environment.

### Prerequisites
* A local server environment like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or MAMP.
* A database manager like phpMyAdmin (included with XAMPP).

### 1. Set up the Database
-   Start the Apache and MySQL services in your XAMPP/MAMP control panel.
-   Open phpMyAdmin and create a new database named `mercearia_db`.
-   Import the `database.sql` file (located in the config folder) into the `mercearia_db` database.

### 2. Configure the Project
-   Clone or download this repository into the `htdocs` (for XAMPP) or `htdocs` (for MAMP) folder.
-   Open the `/config/database.php` file.
-   Update the database credentials according to your local setup (usually, the user is `root` and the password is
    empty by default).
```php
$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_name = 'mercearia_db';
$db_user = 'root'; // Your username
$db_pass = '';     // Your password
```

### 3. Access the Application
-   **Store (Public Page):** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/mercearia-online/public/`.
-   **Admin Panel:** Navigate to `http://localhost/mercearia-online/admin/`.
    -   **Username:** `admin`
    -   **Password:** `admin123`
